<h2> A little about me</h2>
<p>I am Aneesh and this is my first year of college. I do not have much programming knowledge, but I have taken AP Computer Science A in high school
last year, and I enjoyed it. <br></br>I was born in late 2004, so I am still 17 years old. I am originally from Columbus, and I have lived here
my entire life (so far).<br></br> Although I live in Columbus, I decided to live on campus since I felt it would be a better experience than commuting.
I enjoy playing video games, exercising, and playing/teaching guitar. <br></br>I also currently work at Chipotle on the weekend.</p>
